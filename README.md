**OpenRepo** provides integration a quick way to open a git project. It loosely inspired by the [Git Project Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felipecaputo.git-project-manager) extension for Visual Studio Code, though somewhat more simplistic.

## Usage

To run OpenRepo:

- Select the **Editor → Open Repository** menu item; or
- Open the command palette and type `Open Repository`

### Configuration

To configure global preferences, open **Extensions → Extension Library...** then select OpenRepo's **Preferences** tab.

You can also configure preferences on a per-project basis in **Project → Project Settings...**

The settings

* *Path* — The directory where your git repositories are stored.
* *Search depth* — How many directories deep to look for repositories.
